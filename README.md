# WSDC

dependencies:
- SDL3
- SDL3_ttf
- SDL3_image
- [color-name-list](https://github.com/meodai/color-names) (using a modified version of the CSV file in "\_\_COLORS__.hpp")

A SDL3-based graphical and utilitary library for C++
it adds std::string formatting
basic manipulation for some SDL3 objects
and some things I find useful
thats pretty much it

the "samples" folder has some examples of use(see the "levels" for some idiocy)
